## Project Summary
*   **The purpose of the analysis:** is to get useful information from data. Here we are analyzing Customer Segmentation Data for Marketing Analysis
. The basic purpose of this analysis is to get answers of some business questions from this data set that can be helpful in future for success of a marketplace.

*   This project starts with exploring and cleaning a dataset to prepare it for analysis.  The data exploration process involved identifying and understanding the characteristics of the data, such as the data types, missing values, and distributions of values. The data cleaning process involved detecting and resolving  any issues  in the data, such as errors, missing values, or duplicate records and remove=ing outliers. 

*   Once the data has been cleaned and prepared, we will create visualizations graphs and check the relationship between different variables of the dataset.

*   We will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) of this dataset that consists of three steps (1) Univariate Analysis (2) Bivariate Analysis (3) Multivariate Analysis.
